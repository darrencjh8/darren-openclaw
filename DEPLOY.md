# Friday — Deployment

## Production Server

- **Host:** `192.168.68.51` (SSH config alias: `192.168.68.51`)
- **User:** `darren` (sudoer)
- **Auth:** SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- **Project root:** `~/darren-openclaw`
- **Services:** Docker Compose at `~/darren-openclaw/modules/docker-compose.yml`

Manual deploys on production are forbidden. Merging to `main` is the only shipping path.

There is no `gateway/` directory in the repository (`git ls-files gateway` returns nothing). The OpenClaw gateway stack and its `docker-compose.override.yml`, `openclaw.json`, and `workspace/skills/` are retired. Compose lives at `modules/docker-compose.yml`.

## Deployment Flow (CI/CD)

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main` on the self-hosted runner:

1. **Trigger:** push to `main`, plus `workflow_dispatch`. Serialized by concurrency group `production-deploy` (`cancel-in-progress: false`).
2. **Checkout:** the repo, then `darrencjh8/codex-router@main` into `modules/codex-router`.
3. **Detect changed modules** (`git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD`):
   - `modules/hermes/`, `gateway/`, `.github/` → `hermes`
   - `modules/expense-tracker/` → `expense-tracker`
   - `modules/portfolio-tracker/` → `portfolio-tracker`
   - `modules/actual-api/` → `actual-api`
   - changes to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `modules/docker-compose.yml`, or `modules/deploy.sh` → `codex-router`
   - changes to `modules/codex-router-front/` → `codex-router`
   - root `Dockerfile` / `deploy.sh` / `modules/docker-compose.yml`, or nothing matched → `all`
   - The `gateway/` rule is a vestige; that directory no longer exists.
4. **Create data dirs:** `mkdir -p /home/runner/data/{expense-tracker/data,portfolio-tracker/data,hermes/{data,workspace}}`.
5. **Build:** `bash ./modules/build.sh` (all) or `bash ./modules/build.sh --component <c> ...`.
6. **Deploy:** `bash ./modules/deploy.sh --component all --non-interactive --skip-build`, or one `--component <c>` per detected component. `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` makes `deploy.sh` read secrets from the environment instead of `.env` files.
7. **Record:** the deployed codex-router revision is written to `codex-router-sha.txt` and uploaded as a workflow artifact.

`--skip-build` is essential in CI: without it, `deploy.sh` runs its own `git pull` and image build, bypassing the pipeline's change detection and health gate.

### Rolling codex-router update

codex-router is served by three containers: the caddy front `codex-router`, which owns
`0.0.0.0:4100`, and the two identical router colours `codex-router-a` and `codex-router-b`, which
publish no ports. `modules/build.sh` builds the colours and skips the front, which is a stock
`caddy:2-alpine` image. `deploy.sh` never brings the colours up as a group; after the generic
`compose up` it rolls them:

1. Pick the running colour that is not serving, defaulting to `codex-router-a`.
2. `compose up -d --force-recreate codex-router-a` (or `-b`) and wait for `/health/liveliness` on that
   colour. The recreate is deliberate: a colour that runs but never answers is the idle colour on
   every roll, and a plain `up -d` is a no-op on an unchanged container, so that candidate would be
   re-selected and the deploy would fail every time.
3. Start the front if it is not running (its first start is the cutover from the pre-roll layout),
   then reload its Caddyfile. A front that is already running is left alone: it owns the only
   published listener, and `up -d` would recreate it if its stanza or image changed. Because of that,
   a change to the front's own compose stanza (image, memory limit, healthcheck) is applied only by a
   deploy with `force_all=true`.
4. `compose stop -t "$ROUTER_DRAIN_SECONDS" <old colour>` (default 600s) so in-flight streams finish;
   both colours carry `stop_grace_period: 10m` for the same reason.

`deploy.sh` identifies the front by the `modules.role=codex-router-front` label rather than by its
compose service name, because the legacy router container uses that same service name until the
cutover replaces it. The Caddyfile reaches the front as a bind-mounted directory
(`./codex-router-front:/etc/caddy:ro`), not as a single mounted file: a checkout that replaces the
file's inode would otherwise leave the mount pointing at the old one. A colour name is accepted as a
component name (`--component codex-router-a`) and means `codex-router`: `deploy.sh` rewrites it
before the preflight and `build.sh` builds both colours for it.

The front's Caddyfile uses `lb_policy first` with the upstreams written `codex-router-a` then
`codex-router-b`, `lb_try_duration 30s` so a request that lands on a stopping colour is retried, and
`flush_interval -1` so streaming responses are not buffered. If the new colour never becomes ready
the deploy fails without moving the front, and the previously serving colour keeps serving.

### How an environment variable reaches the gateway

A deploy variable travels `deploy.yml` job env → `modules/docker-compose.yml`
`environment:` → the container's process environment. That is enough for tools
and CLIs that read `os.environ`, and `deploy.sh` validates the platform
allowlists (`SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS`, `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`) so a deploy cannot
start a bot nobody can talk to. It is **not** enough for a hermes authorization
allowlist: hermes authorizes a chat caller through the per-profile secret scope
built from `$HERMES_HOME/.env`, and with `gateway.multiplex_profiles: true` a
value that exists only in the container environment reads back empty — the bot
connects and then rejects every caller as unauthorized.

`modules/hermes/50-seed-defaults` closes that gap on every boot by mirroring
each deployed `*_ALLOWED_USERS` into `$HERMES_HOME/.env` (the environment wins,
an unset variable never deletes a key, and the file is replaced atomically at
mode 600). A new allowlist therefore needs no Dockerfile change and no volume
hand-edit: set the variable — a GitHub variable for GHA, `modules/hermes/.env`
for a local deploy — and redeploy.

## Entry Points

### `modules/build.sh`

Builds Docker images with no downtime. Accepts repeatable `--component <name>`; with no component it defaults to `all`. Runs `docker-compose --project-name modules build <services>`. When `portfolio-tracker` (or `all`) is included it first builds `pp-cli.jar` (installs the vendored `pp-cli/lib/name.abuchen.portfolio-0.84.1.jar` into local Maven, then `mvn package`).

```bash
./modules/build.sh --component hermes --component portfolio-tracker
```

### `modules/deploy.sh`

Validates every component's required env vars, then runs `docker-compose --project-name modules up -d`. On GitHub Actions it reads secrets from the environment; locally it reads each module's `.env`. It also ensures the shared `hermes_shared` Docker network and the Hermes workspace exist, and runs health checks afterwards.

```bash
./modules/deploy.sh --component <name> [--component <name>...] [--non-interactive] [--skip-build]
```

- `--component` is **required**; with none it prints usage and exits 1. Choices printed by the script: `all`, `hermes`, `portfolio-tracker`, `expense-tracker`, `actual-api`, `image-gen`, `codex-router`.
- `--non-interactive` skips the OneDrive auth prompt.
- `--skip-build` skips the built-in `git pull` + `docker-compose build` (used by CI, which builds in a separate step).

## Fresh Install

Prerequisite: Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/darren-openclaw
cd ~/darren-openclaw

# Portfolio Tracker (also supplies Actual Budget credentials to actual-api)
cp modules/portfolio-tracker/.env.example modules/portfolio-tracker/.env
# Edit: required vars are listed by guardEnv() in modules/portfolio-tracker/src/index.js

# Expense Tracker
cp modules/expense-tracker/.env.example modules/expense-tracker/.env
# Edit: LLM_*, ACTUAL_*, IMAP_*, NOTIFY_URL, TELEGRAM/HERMES_* as configured

# Image Gen
cp modules/image-gen/.env.example modules/image-gen/.env
```

Hermes reads its configuration and secrets from the environment (CI injects them as secrets and vars) or from `modules/hermes/.env` locally; there is no `modules/hermes/.env.example`.

Deploy locally (never on production):

```bash
./modules/deploy.sh --component all --non-interactive
```

## Module Registration

A module is a Docker image that:

1. Exposes `/health` (compose health check), REST `/tools/*`, and an MCP endpoint at `/mcp`.
2. Is declared as a service in `modules/docker-compose.yml`.
3. Is registered as an MCP server in `modules/hermes/config.yaml` under `mcp_servers:`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
    expense-tracker:
        url: http://expense-tracker:8080/mcp
    portfolio-tracker:
        url: http://portfolio-tracker:8081/mcp
```

Compose runs with project name `modules`, so the default container names are `modules-<service>-1` (for example `modules-portfolio-tracker-1`); `hermes` sets `container_name: hermes`.

`deploy.sh` additionally auto-discovers pluggable modules from `modules/*/module.env`. No module currently ships a `module.env`, so this path is unused today.

## Hermes Skills and Profiles

Skills and profiles are baked into the Hermes image and seeded onto the data volume at boot:

- `modules/hermes/Dockerfile` copies `config.yaml`, `SOUL.md.template`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, and `profiles/` into `/opt/hermes-defaults/`, then installs `50-seed-defaults` as `/etc/cont-init.d/50-seed-defaults`.
- On boot, `modules/hermes/50-seed-defaults`:
  - merges `/opt/hermes-defaults/config.yaml` into `/opt/data/config.yaml` (baked keys win; top-level keys the baked config does not define are carried over),
  - seeds `SOUL.md` only if absent,
  - copies `skills/*` into `/opt/data/skills/` and `scripts/*` into `/opt/data/scripts/`,
  - creates `/opt/data/memories/topics/INDEX.md`,
  - seeds each profile into `/opt/data/profiles/<name>/{config.yaml,SOUL.md,profile.yaml}` (only if absent), removes retired profiles (`static-analyst`, `qa-engineer`, `quality-assurance`), and registers each with `hermes profile create <name> --no-alias`.
- `modules/hermes/scripts/sync-codex-router-skills.sh` reconciles codex-router's canonical skills (staged at `/opt/data/.codex-router-skills` by the deploy) into the managed roots `/opt/data/skills`, `/opt/data/.agents/skills`, and `/opt/data/home/.agents/skills`. A skill removed from the canonical source is removed from every root.
- `modules/hermes/scripts/refresh-codex-router-checkout.sh` advances the container's own codex-router checkout at `/workspace/codex-router`, which is where dev-loop sessions execute the driver from (`codex/skills/dev-loop/scripts/loop.py`). The deploy runs it with the revision it checked out; the boot hook runs it with no target so it tracks `origin/main`. It skips a checkout that is dirty, on another branch, or absent, and exits non-zero when a clean checkout cannot reach the target. It never forces, so a checkout that diverged from `origin/main` (after a force-push, say) keeps failing every deploy; the checkout has to exist before it can be advanced (a session creates it by cloning; the script skips an absent path and the deploy says so), and the recovery is run in the hermes container as its `hermes` owner: `docker exec -u hermes hermes sh -c 'git -C /workspace/codex-router -c credential.helper="!gh auth git-credential" fetch origin main && git -C /workspace/codex-router reset --hard origin/main'` (the outer single quotes keep the `!` away from the interactive shell's history expansion, which would otherwise rewrite or refuse the helper) (a helper is required because the container's git has none and the remote is HTTPS: the script itself prefers the PAT its caller exports as `GH_TOKEN` and falls back to gh's helper, which is the one this interactive recipe names because a shell has no exported PAT, and the reset discards whatever the checkout holds — uncommitted changes and any local commit of its own).

## Adding a New Pluggable Module

1. Build a Docker image exposing `/health`, `/tools/*`, and `/mcp`.
2. Add its service to `modules/docker-compose.yml`.
3. Register its MCP server in `modules/hermes/config.yaml` under `mcp_servers:`.
4. If it needs agent-facing instructions, add `modules/hermes/skills/<module>/SKILL.md`; the boot seed copies it into `/opt/data/skills/`.
5. Ship via a merge to `main` — CI detects the changed `modules/<module>/` path and deploys it.

<!-- TODO(verify): confirm whether a module.env pattern in modules/deploy.sh is intended for future pluggable modules; no module currently ships one. -->
