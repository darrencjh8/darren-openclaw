# Agent Instructions for darren-openclaw

## Communication
- Get to the point. No polite filler ("That's right", "I'm sorry", "Great question", "Sure thing", "Let me explain").
- State the action, result, or next step. Drop conversational fluff.
- Follow global `caveman` ultra guidance for agent communication. Do not compress evidence, safety warnings, code, commands, errors, commits, issues, pull requests, or documentation.

## General

- Always propose a plan before making changes. Wait for explicit approval before implementing.
- Before running any command on production for the first time, ask for explicit approval.
- Never expose or commit credentials, tokens, `.env` files, `modules/expense-tracker/db.sqlite`, or `modules/expense-tracker/metadata.json`.

## Production Server

- Production host details are in global Codex rules.
- Never restart, rebuild, pull, or deploy directly on production. Always use the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
- Never run `docker compose`, `git pull`, `deploy.sh`, or direct deployment commands on production.
- For config-only intervention or CI/CD failure, ask the user for direction; do not perform manual production remediation by default.
- Before any production debug, inspection, test, or verification command, ask for explicit approval.

## Configuration

- Verify any changes against official docs:
  - https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration
  - https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/main/docs
  - https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/hubs
  - https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/main/docs
- Do not guess schema.

## Planning

- Always propose a plan before making changes. Wait for explicit approval.
- Before running any test/verification command on production for the first time, explicitly ask the user for approval — never assume it's safe.

## Implementation
- Start from a clean worktree. If it is dirty, ask the user before proceeding.
- Create `feat/...` or `fix/...` branches. Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- For behavior changes, write a failing test first, implement the minimum passing change, then refactor with tests green.
- For documentation, configuration, or skill changes with no testable behavior, state why TDD does not apply and run relevant validation.
- For code changes that require CI, run one independent fresh-context review subagent. Prefer `deepseek-v4-pro`; do not reuse reviewer context between rounds.
- Fix validated Critical and High findings before merge. Cosmetic notes, style preferences, and coverage-only suggestions do not block the loop.
- Require one clean review round before merge unless the user explicitly changes this requirement.
- Push a branch, open a pull request, wait for required GitHub Actions checks, then squash-merge. CI/CD owns deployment after merge.


## Git Operations

### Primary: Use `gh` CLI
For pushing, pulling, and interacting with GitHub, always prefer the `gh` CLI tool over MCP.

```bash
# Clone
gh repo clone darrencjh8/darren-openclaw

# Create branches
gh repo fork / clone / create

# Pull requests
gh pr create / list / view / merge

# Issues
gh issue create / list / view

# Auth
gh auth login    # One-time setup
gh auth status   # Check current auth state
```

### Secondary: GitHub MCP Server
Use MCP GitHub tools only when `gh` CLI cannot accomplish the task (e.g., searching code across GitHub, creating files directly in repos without local clone).

### Never use:
- MCP `push_files` for initial commits on empty repos (use `gh` + `git` instead)
- MCP for large multi-file pushes (use `git add -A && git commit && git push`)
