"""Deterministic real->synthetic remap of account identifiers.

Safety rules, each one earned by a bug or false positive this repo produced:

1. LONGEST FIRST. Four real values contain another real value as a substring
   (LONG1/SHORT1, LONG2/SHORT2, LONG3/SHORT3, LONG4/SHORT4). Substituting short
   first truncates the 6-digit legs and silently breaks the transfer-pair tests.
2. DIGIT BOUNDARIES ONLY. `<REDACTED:4>` occurs inside a git SHA and inside `<REDACTED:6>`;
   `<REDACTED:4>` inside the merchant `McDonalds <REDACTED:4>01`; `<REDACTED:4>` inside the fixture
   `1234567<REDACTED:4>23456`. A bare str.replace would corrupt all of them.
3. PORT ALLOWLIST. `<REDACTED:4>` is both a real account suffix AND the chrome CDP
   forward port. Files where <REDACTED:4> is a port are never touched.
4. SAME-LENGTH TARGETS, so `A/C ending 7222` keeps the shape parsers key on.
5. LAST-4 PAIRING PRESERVED. The parsers pair a short suffix with a full account
   number by their shared tail, so each long target's last 4 must equal its short
   partner. An earlier map missed this and 2 tests caught it.
6. EMBEDDED REFERENCES FIRST. A real FAST reference appears inside a DBS
   reference as its middle segment, and that shared segment is the only identity
   the two alerts have. Rule 2's digit-boundary guard rejects a value sitting
   between digits, so whole references are replaced before bare tokens.
7. NEVER REWRITE THIS FILE. It is both a tool and a source of the map. An
   earlier version rewrote its own keys into their own targets, after which it
   could no longer match real values and reported "0 changes" while real data
   sat unscrubbed.

The real values live in a git-ignored JSON file, never in this source: see
scripts/pii_patterns.py. This file therefore contains no PII and is safe to
commit to a public repository.
