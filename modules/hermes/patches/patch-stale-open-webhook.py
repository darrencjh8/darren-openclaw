"""Build-time patch for upstream hermes_state.py: reap stale open webhook sessions.

Every webhook delivery gets its own one-shot session (chat id ``webhook:<route>:<delivery_id>``,
so its session key is never reused). Upstream closes it from the adapter's
``on_processing_complete`` hook, but a gateway restart or crash mid-run skips that hook, and
builds before upstream added the hook (between v2026.7.1 and v2026.7.7) never closed them at all.
``prune_sessions`` only deletes ended rows and the automatic stale-open sweep
(``SessionDB._AUTO_PRUNE_STALE_OPEN_SOURCES``) does not list ``webhook``, so those rows stay open
and unpruned forever.

This patch adds ``webhook`` to that tuple. The sweep closes (``startup_orphan_reap``, non-destructive,
resumable) only rows whose start and last activity are both older than ``retention_days``, so a
live delivery is never touched. slack, telegram and the other messaging sources are deliberately
left out: their sessions can be live conversations.

Usage: patch-stale-open-webhook.py [path]   (default /opt/hermes/hermes_state.py)
Idempotent; exits non-zero if the upstream text has drifted, so an image bump that changes this
code fails the build instead of silently dropping the fix.
