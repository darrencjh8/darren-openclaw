"""Build-time patch for upstream gateway/lifecycle_ledger.py (issue #650).

Upstream runs ``PRAGMA quick_check(1)`` on state.db synchronously on the event
loop thread whenever the previous gateway life died uncleanly. On a multi-GB
store that is an hour or more of silent startup. This patch keeps the check but
runs it on a daemon thread:

* record_startup() returns immediately; the evidence dict and the first
  ``gateway.previous_unclean_exit`` exit-diag record carry
  ``state_db_integrity: "pending"`` (never "ok" for a check that has not run).
* The real verdict is logged and appended to gateway-exit-diag.log as a
  ``gateway.state_db_integrity_check`` record when the check finishes.

Usage: patch-lifecycle-ledger.py [path]   (default /opt/hermes/gateway/lifecycle_ledger.py)
The patch is idempotent and exits non-zero if the upstream text has drifted, so
an image bump that changes this code fails the build instead of silently
dropping the fix.
