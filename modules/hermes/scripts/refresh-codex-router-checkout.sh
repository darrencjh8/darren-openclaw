# Advance the Hermes container's own codex-router checkout.
#
# Dev-loop sessions inside the container drive the gate from their codex-router
# checkout (`codex/skills/dev-loop/scripts/loop.py`), so a checkout pinned to an
# old revision keeps running an old gate no matter what the reconciled skill roots
# hold. Measured 2026-09-25: /workspace/codex-router sat at 2e0fcfc, six commits
# behind origin/main, while the roots were current, so the deployed driver never
# reached a session (darren-openclaw#613).
#
# Two writers call this: the deploy, with the revision it checked out, and the boot
# hook, with no argument so it tracks origin/main and a recreated container heals
# itself.
#
# Usage: refresh-codex-router-checkout.sh [TARGET_REV]
#   TARGET_REV is any commit reachable from the fetched branch head. Without it the
#   script advances to the fetched head.
#
# Exit status: 0 when the checkout was advanced or deliberately left alone
# (absent, dirty, on another branch, detached, or already at the target). Non-zero
# when a clean checkout cannot reach the target, when another writer holds the lock
# past LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS, or when the fetch fails; the deploy counts any of those as
# a failure because they mean the environment disagrees with what was shipped.
