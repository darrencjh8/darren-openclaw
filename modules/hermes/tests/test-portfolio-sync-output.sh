# Regression test for the round-trip status lines in portfolio-sync.sh.
#
# The defect this covers: a dead OneDrive grant was reported as a successful pull,
# so the daily job printed a clean summary and the spreadsheet was written from a
# stale local portfolio file. Its output was indistinguishable from a healthy run.
#
# This test runs the SHIPPED script with a stubbed curl and asserts on its stdout.
# It deliberately does NOT extract the parse block and run it separately: a test
# that reads the block off disk and feeds it to its own `python3 -c` bypasses
# bash's parse-time quote removal, which is the only step that mangles the text.
# Such a test passes on a script that prints nothing at all, so it certifies the
# defect instead of catching it.
