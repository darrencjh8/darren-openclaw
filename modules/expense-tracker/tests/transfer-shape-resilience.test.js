/**
 * Regression coverage for the held-transfer families found in the production
 * logs of 2026-10-01..2026-10-04 (expense-tracker).
 *
 * Every body below is a real alert. Third-party person names are replaced with
 * placeholders; amounts, dates, times, masked suffixes and product wording are
 * retained, because they are what resolution keys on. The holder's own name
 * strings ("Darren DBS", "Hi Darren") are kept, matching the existing
 * convention in `bank-movement.test.js`. Reference numbers are truncated to
 * their leading segment: no assertion here depends on their tail, and they are
 * the highest-entropy identifier in the body.
 *
 * Three production defects of 2026-10-01 are covered:
 *
 *  1. A DBS bill payment whose destination is one of the holder's own credit
 *     card accounts was booked as an external payment and posted a phantom
 *     expense. Two shapes: the destination named by product ("CITI CREDIT
 *     CARDS", a payee alias rather than an account name, so it cannot resolve
 *     by name at all) and the destination named by an EXISTING card account
 *     ("Altitude"/"Yuu" -> "DBS Altitude Card"/"DBS Yuu Card"), which the
 *     transfer gate refused even though the parser had already resolved both
 *     legs. RED on unmodified origin/main (uid 1025, 1031).
 *
 *  2. Ryt's "Scheduled transfer completed successfully!" sentence form had no
 *     branch at all, so the alert parsed as null and fell through to the LLM
 *     extractor, which could not read it either — the transfer was dropped and
 *     the user was told the email could not be understood (uid 999/1010/1012).
 *     RED on unmodified origin/main.
 *
 *  3. The OCBC "We have processed your funds transfer request" body arrives
 *     flattened to ONE line. `restoreFieldLines` (added in #377) re-inserts the
 *     label breaks that make `field()`'s line-anchored read work, so this shape
 *     already parses on origin/main. These two cases are therefore guard tests
 *     rather than RED: they pin the flattened-body contract that the fixes
 *     above must not disturb.
