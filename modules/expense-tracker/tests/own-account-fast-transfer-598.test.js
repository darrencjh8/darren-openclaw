/**
 * Regression coverage for issue #598: one own-account FAST transfer
 * (OCBC 360 -> POSB Cashback, SGD 1,000.00, 2026-09-23) produced TWO separate
 * `Misc` rows with no category, one on each leg, instead of one transfer pair.
 *
 * Both alert bodies below are the production bodies verbatim: the only edits
 * are the account holder's legal name -> "ACCOUNT HOLDER", and the statement
 * password mnemonic is dropped from the legal-name fact. Amounts, dates, times,
 * reference numbers, suffixes, and product names are retained — they are what
 * resolution keys on, and they are not secret.
 *
 * The load-bearing detail is the reference: the OCBC ref `2609230019902668`
 * appears inside the DBS ref `012609230019902668EPS7678794` as its middle
 * segment, which is the only identity the two alerts share.
