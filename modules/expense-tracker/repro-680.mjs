// Issue #680 — reproduction probe for the dropped incoming credit.
//
// This file is the payload of `loop.py repro`. It lives in the repository and is
// tracked, so the driver can run it in its throwaway BASE worktree (which has
// tracked files only). It is a plain script rather than a test file because the
// RED test for this bug is new in this change and therefore does not exist at
// base — see darrencjh8/codex-router#352.
//
// It prints a line naming the reproduction on failure and exits non-zero, so the
// driver's `failure_line_mentions` check has real evidence to read.
