/**
 * The #627 renderer contract must be enforced by a CI job that can actually
 * block a merge.
 *
 * dev-loop code review round 3, Medium: tests/onedrive-legs.test.js and its
 * siblings live in the `portfolio-tracker` job, which carries
 * `continue-on-error: true` because the FULL suite needs IBKR keys and live
 * services. deploy.yml gates on `needs.test.result != 'failure'`, and a
 * continue-on-error job reports success even when its steps fail, so every JS
 * test protecting formatSyncResult could be deleted or broken without blocking
 * a deploy. Only the hermes shell test was actually enforced.
 *
 * The fix is the separate `portfolio-tracker-unit` job: the renderer tests need
 * no secrets and no services, so they run in a job that is allowed to fail the
 * workflow. These assertions are what stop that job from silently regressing
 * back to non-gating.
