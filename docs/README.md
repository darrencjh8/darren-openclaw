# Friday — knowledge base

How Friday is put together, how to run it, and where each decision is written
down. The [root README](../README.md) stays a short overview; the detail lives
here.

## Start here

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | The Docker Compose topology, the service graph, and the expense- and portfolio-tracking pipelines end to end. |
| [repository-layout.md](repository-layout.md) | Every directory and what belongs in it, plus the modules that are present but not deployed. |
| [setup.md](setup.md) | Clone, per-module `.env`, and the `deploy.sh` / `build.sh` entry points. |
| [operations.md](operations.md) | Health endpoints, the CI/CD deploy flow, the other workflows, and the published ports. |

## Specifications

Feature specs live in [specs/](../specs/), one directory per feature. Most follow
the Spec-Kit layout (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`); the smaller ones carry
only the files they need.

## Design notes and plans

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [plans/](plans/) | The approved plan for each change of substance: the Hermes container's codex-router checkout, DeepSeek Flash routing, LiteLLM account-pool fallbacks, and the bill-payment and transfer-pair fixes. |
| [expense-tracker/spec-code-drift-verification-2026-06-23.md](expense-tracker/spec-code-drift-verification-2026-06-23.md) | Generated check that the expense-tracker spec still matches the shipped code. |

## Documents that stay at the root

These are operationally load-bearing where they are, so they are not moved here.
