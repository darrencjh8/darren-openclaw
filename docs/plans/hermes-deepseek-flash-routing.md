# Hermes DeepSeek Flash Routing

## Status: historical

This plan proposed splitting DeepSeek fallbacks across tiered model names (a pro tier
for the hard routes, a flash tier for the light ones, and a separate vision model).
That split is retired: every DeepSeek fallback in Hermes uses the single canonical
model id `deepseek-flash`. See darrencjh8/darren-openclaw#428. The primary slots have
since moved again — auxiliary traffic now runs on the router's Command Code DeepSeek
Flash model, except the approval judge which keeps `auto-thinking`, and every profile
shares the `auto-thinking` pool — so the table below,
not the original proposal, is the current contract.

## Routing today

| Role | Primary | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main agent | codex-router / `auto-thinking` (reasoning high) | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Delegation | codex-router / `auto-thinking` | none (not supported) |
| Vision | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Web extract | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Compression | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Approval | codex-router / `auto-thinking` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Kanban decomposer | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Triage specifier | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| Profile describer | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| architect profile | codex-router / `auto-thinking` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| code-reviewer profile | codex-router / `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (reasoning high) | codex-router / `auto-thinking` |
| spec-auditor profile | codex-router / `auto-thinking` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |
| project-manager profile | codex-router / `auto-thinking` | direct / `deepseek-flash` |

Hermes resolves `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` automatically for the named `deepseek` provider,
which serves every direct fallback. No Hermes DeepSeek *fallback* traffic flows through
codex-router; codex-router still hops to DeepSeek itself inside the `auto-thinking`
pool. The `commandcode/*` primaries require `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` in the router's
environment and are advertised in its catalog only while that key is present.

The reasoning effort shown for the main agent is the only effort this plan pins. The
profiles set their own: `architect` and `spec-auditor` at `medium`,
`project-manager` at `low`, `code-reviewer` at `high`. All four profiles route through
`auto-thinking` except `code-reviewer`, which pins the Command Code route directly, so
the router's pool also chooses an effort per hop for the slots that use it.

`code-reviewer` is the one slot whose fallback is not the direct `deepseek` provider:
it falls back to `custom:codex-router` / `auto-thinking`. The direction matters — a
review round runs the Command Code Flash model and *escalates* to the pooled route when
that is unavailable, so an outage never serves a review from a weaker tier than the one
chosen for it. That is the opposite of the earlier `fallback_providers: []`, which made
the round fail closed instead.

## Notes

- Codex Router exposes DeepSeek through two distinct families: the native
  `deepseek-flash` route over the Responses transport, and the Command Code models
  published as `commandcode/deepseek/*`. The auxiliary slots use the latter; every
  fallback uses the former on the direct `deepseek` provider.
- The native `deepseek-flash` route is reachable only over the Responses transport.
- `50-seed-defaults` reseeds every config key the baked `config.yaml` defines and
  force-migrates the managed profile routing fields (`providers`, `model`,
  `fallback_providers`) on every boot, so all routing changes must land in the repo
  defaults — runtime edits to those keys under `/opt/data` do not persist. A top-level
  key the baked config does not define (for example the codex-router `hooks:`) is
  preserved across the reseed.
- Deployment is a reviewed pull request followed by GitHub Actions. CI/CD owns the
  rollout; never restart, rebuild, pull, or run Docker Compose on production.
