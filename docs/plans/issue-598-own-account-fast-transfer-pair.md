QUESTIONS
q: Does AC-3's "ambiguous/absent match stays held" require holding when no far-side row is found at all? | assumption: No. "Absent" in AC-3 describes the #598 production shape, where the far leg was never booked as a transfer and the near leg was being booked as a Misc expense instead of being held. The fix holds exactly that case. In the ordinary transfer path no far row exists yet, so there is nothing to link and Actual's own engine pairs the counterpart from the transfer payee; holding there would stall every normal transfer until its other leg arrived, which is a worse defect than the one being fixed. The narrower gap — a far row that exists but is invisible to the read because of its payee, its cleared flag, or a timezone day skew — is recorded as accepted risk with a tracking issue rather than fixed here.
q: Should the settle-based AC-3 proof become a CI test in this same change? | assumption: No, not in this change. It needs a multi-second settle to let `updateTransaction`'s async batch flush, which makes it slow and timing-dependent in CI, and adding it would commit a new revision and reset the two review approvals already recorded on this HEAD. It is recorded on the pull request as verification and tracked as a follow-up issue.

# Plan: #598 own-account FAST transfer pair

## Goal

One own-account FAST transfer (OCBC 360 → POSB Cashback, SGD 1,000.00, 2026-09-23, ref `2609230019902668`) must book as a single transfer pair instead of two unclassified `Misc` rows, and the two legs must link both ways once both exist.

## Status of this change

The implementation is already written and reviewed on branch `fix/598-own-account-fast-transfer-pair`: three commits (`2be2232`, `83bf200`, `a4be72b`) against `c0113b7`. Four review rounds ran under the previous gate protocol and closed two High, two Medium, and one Low finding; the last two rounds returned APPROVE on the unchanged HEAD, and CI is green on `a4be72b`.

This plan therefore records the change under the current gate rather than proposing new work. There are no further code mutations: everything the plan describes is already committed and covered by tests in this branch. The only open item is a Low finding, which this plan disposes of as accepted risk in line with the policy that a Low or Nit finding is closed by disposition and never by mutation.

## The defect, and why it needed three commits

The transfer arrives as two separate bank alerts (OCBC outgoing, DBS inbound) and each one was booked independently:

1. The DBS inbound sentence form carries no `Amount :` label, so `parseBankMovement` returned `null`, the movement fell through to the LLM extractor, and it was booked as an unclassified `Misc` credit. Fixed by the DBS inbound FAST branch in `bank-movement.js`.
2. The OCBC leg parsed, but its destination `Darren POSB (-804380)` resolved to no live account, so the leg was not recognised as a transfer. Fixed by the suffix and recipient-bank resolution in `bank-movement.js` and the suffix-learning gate in `orchestrator.js`.
3. Once both rows existed, nothing linked them. Linking after the insert is too late: the near leg is inserted carrying the other account's transfer payee, and the Actual engine's `runTransfers` then creates a *second* counterpart row, after which the link route rejects the already-linked leg. Fixed by deciding the existing far side **before** the insert and suppressing the derived transfer payee at the wire.

## What each changed file does

- `modules/expense-tracker/src/bank-movement.js` — parses the DBS inbound FAST notice; carries `recipient_bank`; resolves the destination through the account's own suffix.
- `modules/expense-tracker/src/orchestrator.js` — `_findExistingFarSide` decides the far side before `reserve_transfer` (so a hold reserves nothing and stays retryable); holds on an ambiguous or wrong-account candidate instead of degrading to the duplicate-creating path; passes `suppress_transfer_payee`; fixes the suffix-learning gate so a suffix is only learned from evidence that actually names the account.
- `modules/expense-tracker/src/tools.js` — `find_link_candidate` returns `{candidate, matches}` so "no far side" is distinguishable from "several candidates"; `insert_transaction` honours `suppress_transfer_payee` where the payee is actually decided, not merely at the argument.
- `modules/actual-api/server.js` — `POST /transactions/link-transfer` writes each leg's `transfer_id` to the other, standing in for `runTransfers`, which creates a counterpart instead of linking two existing rows.
- `modules/expense-tracker/docs/transfer-inference-test-plan.md` — documents the linking path and its pass criteria.

## Verification

- Reproduction recorded at the base revision: the DBS inbound body fails to parse as an incoming movement at `0faf111` and parses at HEAD.
- Targeted tests: `modules/expense-tracker/tests/own-account-fast-transfer-598.test.js` (17 tests, including wire-level assertions that the transfer payee is suppressed, driven through the real `ToolRegistry` rather than a mock), `modules/actual-api/__tests__/link_transfer.test.js` (+7 tests).
- Mutation check: disabling the payee suppression turns the wire-level test red, so the test guards the defect rather than restating the implementation.
- Full suites: expense-tracker 1163 passed / 5 skipped; actual-api jest 199 passed.
- End-to-end on a real budget: seeding the two legs as ordinary rows and replaying the route's two writes produces both `transfer_id`s pointing at each other, both categories null, and exactly two rows with no counterpart. This required waiting for the async batch to settle; an immediate read reports a stale state and wrongly suggests only one write landed.

## Accepted risk

The far-side read recognizes one row shape: an uncleared, unlinked row on the far account, on the same calendar day, at the opposite signed amount, still on the unclassified `Misc` payee. A far row that exists but differs — a different payee, a cleared row, or a leg whose date was resolved through the LLM path's UTC normalisation instead of the parser's SGT slice — is invisible to the read, so the near leg is booked with its transfer payee and the duplicate shape can recur. Fail-closed behaviour currently covers only multiple candidates. This is a fail-open read and the sharper half of the finding is real; it is accepted as risk with a tracking issue rather than fixed here, because closing it means widening the detection heuristic, which is a larger change than the defect it guards and carries its own risk of linking rows that are not a pair.

## Test plan

No new tests: the change under this plan is already covered, and the policy forbids mutating for a Low finding. The recorded reproduction is replayed by the test gate at HEAD, so the fix must still stop the reproduction or the gate fails closed.

## Follow-ups to file

1. The far-side read's fail-open gap above, with the reproduction shape and the wrong-account/absent-match reasoning.
2. Promote the settle-based end-to-end proof into CI, so a future change to the link route cannot silently break it.
